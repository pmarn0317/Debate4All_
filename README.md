# Debate4All_

# A website where debaters(users) can find other debaters to use as practice opponents. The users will be able to find other users based on debate format, experience, and the date and time preferences. 

# The users can find practice opponents either through using the scheduling form or by adding themselves to a scheduled debate. 

How user will schedule debate:
Use the scheduling form to add a debate based on their specifications.
The info from the form will be displayed in a table where other users can "add" themselves to the scheduled debate. 
Once another user adds themselves the two users will get an email with either a video chat link or with each other's contact info so they can set up the video chat themselves. 

# A basic website is done
# The table for finding debates is a work in progress
